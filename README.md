## Why AgriSmart?

Farming is challenging, especially with unpredictable weather, soil conditions, and market fluctuations. AgriSmart supports farmers by integrating advanced technologies like machine learning and data analytics to:

- Recommend the best crops suited for their land and climate.
- Analyze soil fertility to optimize nutrient management.
- Detect crop diseases early to reduce loss.
- Provide up-to-date market rates to maximize profit.
- Deliver the latest agricultural news for informed decisions.

## Key Features & Services
1.**Crop Recommendation**
   Using machine learning algorithms, we analyze soil data, weather conditions, and historical crop performance to recommend the most suitable crops for a 
   specific location.

2.**Soil Fertility Range Analysis**
   Evaluate soil health parameters like pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels to suggest appropriate fertilization strategies.

3.**Crop Disease Detection**
   Upload images of plants and get instant diagnosis of common crop diseases with recommended treatments to save your crops from damage.

4.**Market Rate Updates**
   Real-time updates on crop prices from various markets help farmers decide the best time to sell their produce.

5.**Agricultural News**
   Stay informed with the latest news, trends, and government policies affecting agriculture.

6. **Seed Purchasing Contacts**  
   Access verified seed suppliers and their contact details to ensure quality inputs.
7. **User Authentication**  
   Secure login and registration system for personalized experience and data security.

## üå± Crop Recommendation ‚Äî Features and Model Selection

### Input Features

- **N (Nitrogen), P (Phosphorus), K (Potassium):** Essential soil nutrients influencing plant growth.
- **Temperature:** Average ambient temperature affecting crop viability.
- **Humidity:** Atmospheric moisture levels impacting plant health.
- **pH:** Soil acidity or alkalinity, critical for nutrient availability.
- **Rainfall:** Total precipitation supporting crop irrigation.
- **Label:** The target crop type to be recommended.

### Model Evaluation

We tested multiple machine learning models from the `scikit-learn` library:

- Logistic Regression
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Extra Trees Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Bagging Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- AdaBoost Classifier

### ‚úÖ Final Model: **Random Forest Classifier**

Random Forest gave the best results in terms of accuracy and generalization, making it the most suitable for recommending crops based on environmental and soil features.

## üåø Soil Fertility Range Analysis ‚Äî Features and Model Selection

### Input Features

- **N (Nitrogen)**
- **P (Phosphorus)**
- **K (Potassium)**
- **pH (Soil Acidity)**
- **EC (Electrical Conductivity)**
- **OC (Organic Carbon)**
- **S (Sulphur)**
- **Zn (Zinc)**
- **Fe (Iron)**
- **Cu (Copper)**
- **Mn (Manganese)**
- **B (Boron)**

These features help evaluate soil fertility status and guide farmers in applying the right fertilizers or soil conditioners.

### Model Evaluation

We trained the soil fertility model using the following algorithms:

- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree Classifier

### ‚úÖ Final Model: **Random Forest Classifier**

After testing multiple classifiers, the **Random Forest Classifier** (non-ensemble) achieved the highest performance in predicting soil fertility classes and was selected as the final model for deployment.
